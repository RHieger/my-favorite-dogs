### Version 2.5 Release Notes

Now that Version 2.1 is fully functional and accepts input from the user I turn my attention to some minimal data validation.

For example, my aim is to trap validation errors such as for the following using the ECMAScript Regex Engine:

1. The user does not enter a value for every field.
2. The user enters an invalid value for one of the fields.
